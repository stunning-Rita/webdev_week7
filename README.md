# webdev_week7🎨 Web Animation Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS transitions, keyframe animations, and JavaScript functions in a simple interactive web page. It was created as part of a Web Development assignment to showcase structured content, styling, functional logic, and animation triggers.

🚀 Features

HTML (index.html)

Semantic structure with header, main content, and footer.

Interactive button to trigger animations.

CSS (styles.css)

Smooth transitions on hover.

Keyframe animations (bouncing effect).

Responsive and visually appealing design.

JavaScript (script.js)

Function demonstrating scope, parameters, and return values.

Button click event listener toggling the animation.

Logs return messages (e.g., "Animation started!" / "Animation stopped!").

🛠️ How to Run

Download or clone this repository.

git clone <repo-url>
cd WebAnimation_Project


Open index.html in any modern web browser.

Hover over the green box to see transition effects.

Click the Animate Box button to start/stop the bouncing animation.

🎯 Learning Objectives Demonstrated

Building structured HTML content.

Applying CSS transitions and animations.

Writing JavaScript functions with parameters, return values, and scope.

Using event listeners to trigger animations.

📖 Example Interaction

Hover on the box → It enlarges and changes color.

Click the button → Box starts bouncing.

Click again → Animation stops.

🧩 Reflection

This assignment was useful in reinforcing:

How CSS keyframes can create smooth animations.

The importance of JavaScript functions for modular, reusable logic.

How user interactions (button clicks, hover effects) can be combined with animations to create a dynamic web experience.
